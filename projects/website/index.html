While I have previously helped with the development of React Single Page Application websites, as well as worked on a Jekyll-based internal blog, I would still describe myself as inexperienced when it comes to web development. CSS in particular has proven tricky, and I'm sure that comes across in the design of this website.</p><p>When I considered the need for a website documenting my career, I immediately reached for <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a> by <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell">John Sundell</a>. I've long been a fan of his work on <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com/">Swift By Sundell</a>, and as such had already heard about his static site generator based on Swift, but I hadn't had the opportunity to work with it before. Being able to leverage my preferred language has been enjoyable, though I'm sure from a visual standpoint I would have made greater progress with something like Jekyll and the many themes that are available for it.</p><p>Using Publish has helped me gain a better understanding (and appreciation) of how a declarative Domain-specific-language like SwiftUI works, through Publish's own component-based DSL. It's only by using something you're familiar with (like Swift) in many different contexts that you can truly understand it's benefits, and get to know it's limitations.</p><p>It is my hope that I might be able to contribute back to the Publish community - in particular, a mechanism to watch and automatically re-run a local instance (as is common in React applications) would greatly help development.</p></div><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/open-source">Open Source</a></li><li><a href="/tags/web">Web</a></li><li><a href="/tags/swift">Swift</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p></footer></body></html>
