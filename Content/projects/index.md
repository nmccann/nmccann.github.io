# Projects

Below are listed some of the projects that I have worked on over my career, many of which would not have been possible without the concerted effort of my wonderful team members on each respective project. It has been through close collaboration with various team members over the years, that I have been been able to mature into the capable and confident developer that I am today.

Where possible, I have provided screenshots or links to more resources, but due to the nature of many of these projects as internal-use-only for enterprise clients, that has not always been possible. 

A more complete (though less detailed) listing can be found in my [resume](/files/Noah-McCann-Resume.pdf).
