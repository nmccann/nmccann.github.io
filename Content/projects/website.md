This website itself has been a learning opportunity. While I have previously helped with the development of React Single Page Application websites, as well as worked on a Jekyll-based internal blog, I would still describe myself as inexperienced when it comes to web development. CSS in particular has proven tricky, and I'm sure that comes across in the design of this website.

When I considered the need for a website documenting my career, I immediately reached for [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) by [John Sundell](https://github.com/JohnSundell). I've long been a fan of his work on [Swift By Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/), and as such had already heard about his static site generator based on Swift, but I hadn't had the opportunity to work with it before. Being able to leverage my preferred language has been enjoyable, though I'm sure from a visual standpoint I would have made greater progress with something like Jekyll and the many themes that are available for it.

Using Publish has helped me gain a better understanding (and appreciation) of how a declarative Domain-specific-language like SwiftUI works, through Publish's own component-based DSL. It's only by using something you're familiar with (like Swift) in many different contexts that you can truly understand it's benefits, and get to know it's limitations.

It is my hope that I might be able to contribute back to the Publish community - in particular, a mechanism to watch and automatically re-run a local instance (as is common in React applications) would greatly help development.
