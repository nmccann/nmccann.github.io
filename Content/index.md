# Intro

Hi, my name is Noah McCann. I am a software developer, specializing in iOS Development – a skill which I have had the pleasure of refining for the last 10 years. Outside of development, I enjoy being an attentive father to my young daughter, a supportive husband for my lovely wife, and a caregiver for our two pet rabbits – who aggressively dislike one another. I also take time to engage in a variety of hobbies – including drawing, writing, videogames, baking, and most recently: riding horses (alongside my far more capable daughter).

I hope you take the time to look through my past projects, as well as my [resume](/files/Noah-McCann-Resume.pdf).

Thank you,  
Noah
